# CS61B

My work on CS61B (Spring 2019 version) of UC Berkeley.  

  Proj1： Implementations of Data Structures  
  - Implemented a double ended queue (deque) in Java using both linked lists and arrays.  
  - Developed a character-comparator interface by converting the input string into a deque and further applied it for checking if a given string is a palindrome.  
  - Debugged and tested the implementations with JUnit in IntelliJ.  
  
  Proj2： Web Map
  - A Web mapping application similar to Google Maps.  
  - The interface supports scrolling, zooming, and route finding on the map.  
  - Implemented the back-end code for parsing the input URL and communicate with the front end.  

  Proj3： World Generation Game  
  - Created an engine for generating explorable world similar to a Roguelike game in Java.  
  - The game is tile-based and the world is generated by pseudorandomness with user’s input. It can be saved and will load to the exact state it was.  
  - The user can walk around and interact with the objects in that world through keyboard input.
